Postmortem
A postmortem (or post-mortem) is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.

Postmortem: Database Outage on March 1, 2024
Issue Summary:
Duration: march 1, 2024, 03:30 PM - 05:15 PM
Impact: The outage affected our core database service, resulting in a complete unavailability of data for approximately 15% of users. Users experienced error messages and an inability to access or modify their data during the incident.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a database schema migration script that inadvertently introduced a deadlock condition, halting critical database operations.
Timeline:
03:30 PM: Issue detected by automated monitoring systems, highlighting a spike in database errors and connection timeouts.
03:35 PM: Engineering team alerted to investigate the database-related issues.
03:40 PM: Initial assumption made that increased user activity was overwhelming the database servers.
03:50 PM: Scaling measures initiated to accommodate assumed increase in database load.
04:00 PM: No improvement observed; incident escalated to database administration and application development teams.
04:15 PM: Misleading path - Investigation focused on network issues, delaying the identification of the root cause.
04:30 PM: Database administrators discovered the deadlock condition introduced by a recent schema migration script.
04:45 PM: Script rolled back to previous version, resolving the deadlock and restoring database operations.
05:15 PM: Database service fully recovered; monitoring systems confirmed normal operations.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: A database schema migration script introduced a deadlock condition due to a flawed transaction sequence, halting critical database operations. Resolution: The problematic migration script was rolled back to the previous version, eliminating the deadlock condition and restoring normal database operations. Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement rigorous testing procedures for database schema migration scripts before deployment. Enhance monitoring to include specific checks for deadlock conditions and database transaction errors. Update incident response playbooks to include detailed steps for identifying and resolving deadlock issues.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

Conduct a thorough review of recent database schema changes to identify and address potential issues. Establish a process for peer review of database schema migration scripts before deployment. Enhance documentation on database deadlock resolution procedures for future incidents.

Conclusion:
The database outage on march 1, 2024, was caused by a deadlock condition introduced by a flawed schema migration script. The incident was promptly detected, but initial assumptions led to a delay in identifying the root cause. Once the deadlock condition was discovered, corrective measures were taken to roll back the problematic script, restoring normal database operations. To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will focus on improving testing procedures for schema migration scripts, enhancing monitoring for specific database issues, and updating documentation to better guide incident response efforts.
